"48","MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MTcwMDU4","AlexisDeschamps","Fix slow doEmpty by using EVENT_OBJECT_SCHEMA

This fix improves the performance of MySQLSchema.doEmpty for MySQL 5.7 without changing the expected behavior.

The subquery `SELECT 1 as found FROM information_schema.triggers WHERE trigger_schema=? AND  LIMIT 1` is changed to `SELECT 1 as found FROM information_schema.triggers WHERE event_object_schema=? AND  LIMIT 1`.

As specified here: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-infoschema-excerpt/5.7/en/triggers-table.html, ""every trigger is associated with exactly one table"" and EVENT_OBJECT_SCHEMA is the ""schema (database) in which this table occurs"" and TRIGGER_SCHEMA is ""The name of the schema (database) to which the trigger belongs"". If a trigger belons to a table that belongs to schema X, then that trigger must belong to schema X. Thus, if one's goal is to find if there any triggers associated with a specific schema, one can filter by EVENT_OBJECT_SCHEMA.

As specified here: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/information-schema-optimization.html, filtering by EVENT_OBJECT_SCHEMA is faster than filtering by TRIGGER_SCHEMA because it is a ""Column to specify to avoid data directory scan"".

Renamed Spatial to Locator whenever occurred. Spatial is a separate paid option, while Locator is free and available even on XE and is actually meant in the code (see Oracle white paper on Spatial). Only metadata is cleaned, and domain indexes should be dropped along with other objects.

* Fixed #1231 upgrading AWS Redshift DB from Flyway 3.2.1 to 4.0 failed

Flyway couldn't upgrade the metadata table, due to the following error:
""Amazon Invalid operation: cannot insert/update into table after dropping
non-nullable column""

This was caused by trying to remove the NOT NULL constraint on the version
column by adding/dropping a temp columan and copying the values. For somae
unknown reason, this works on some versions of Redshift, but not others.
The solution is just to rename the original table, create a new one, copy
the data, and drop the original table.

* Configured SORTKEY for the metadata table in Redshift

Redshift does not support indexes because it is a column-oriented
database. Instead data can be physically stored sorted, to improve
reading and sorting performance, based on the sort key.

There are some known bugs with the EDB JDBC drivers, which prevent

It has been set up as an EmbeddedDB, although the Phoenix tests
are disabled by default unless run in the new 'PhoenixDBTest'
profile via:

mvn test -P PhoenixDBTest -P-CommercialDBTest -P-InstallableDBTest

Notable changes to core classes:

* MetaDataTableImpl:

Due to Phoenix's peculiar syntax, the hardcoded statements in
addAppliedMigration() and updateChecksum() won't work. It now
attempts to load a .sql template and run that, if it exists.

* MigrationTestCase:

Added checks for applied migrations of type MigrationType.SCHEMA
and adjusted asserts accordingly. Also added 'getBaseDir()' and
'getMigrationDir()' methods and replaced direct calls to BASEDIR
or other hardcode paths with them. Several of the tests in
MigrationTestCase can then be used in the Phoenix tests by
implementing those method. There are, however, a few cases due
to incompatible SQL, or other Phoenix quirks, where specific
tests are overridden.","0","0"

This plugin is integrated into the Maven build using the

""'base_catalog_table_seq'"" and ""regclass""

The verbose option was not recognised as such in the liquibase.integration.commandline.Main class. When recognised all options are expected to have a value but boolean options/flags do not necessarily need this. An option like --verbose does not need explicit --verbose=true, even the commandline help instructions say --verbose is enough.

Why did you make this change?

The includeAll feature doesn't work with spring-boot packaged jar files.

Something chnaged in the path format that liquibase isn't able to
handle. It attempts to load the resources in the given path, but isn't
able to find the files because the path isn't pointing to the correct
place in the jar file.

I created a simple utility class to check for the signature of
the spring boot fat jar, which is that it includes 2 exclamation points,
and modified the path to correctly load the resources in the given path.

YAML files can contain custom object definitions, containing method

By passing a SafeConstructor into SnakeYAML, we limit the objects it
will construct and deny this potential exploit.

Unfortunately this makes yaml.loadAs(stream, Map.class) not work because
Map is not recognised as a valid tag. Instead we can 'load' and cast to
Map. If a ClassCastException is thrown it will be caught by the catch-all

Why did you make this change?

The includeAll feature doesn't work with spring-boot packaged jar files.

Something chnaged in the path format that liquibase isn't able to
handle. It attempts to load the resources in the given path, but isn't
able to find the files because the path isn't pointing to the correct
place in the jar file.

I created a simple utility class to check for the signature of
the spring boot fat jar, which is that it includes 2 exclamation points,
and modified the path to correctly load the resources in the given path.

Fixes an issue where validating classloaders will fail to load the

liquibase-core.jar's META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file doesn't match
the version specified in the pom files.

snakeyaml-1.13.jar vs. snakeyaml-1.17.jar

Rather than simply updating the META-INF/MANIFEST.MF file to match
the pom files, this patch removes the 'Class-Path:' entry from the
file altogether. The rational for this is that the 'Class-Path:'
mechanism is an anachronism which is fundamentally at odds with the
dynamic dependency management features of Maven. The liquibase-core

In Oracle 12c, creating a table with an autoincrement column makes Oracle also

Attempting to drop a system-generated sequence results in an ORA-32794 error,
which would make the dropAll command fail. This change makes dropAll skip all

When generating the changelog, use the
comparison database instead of the
reference database to find the column types.

E.g. if your comparison database is
PostgreSQL, and your reference database
is Hibernate (liquibase-hibernate extension)
then this will use PostgreSQL data types
in the changelog, that you can
properly apply to your comparison database.

Otherwise you would have to do an
additional step of translating
Hibernate data types (if they exist)
into PostgreSQL data types,
before the changelog were to become
applicable to the comparison database.","0","0"

By default getConnectionSchemaName calls an sql statement that obtains
the current schema. Not only does this force a custom database to copy
the code just so it can modify the call statement, but it is also error
prone as when the base implementation evolves the changes don't occur in
overridden classes. Such error occurred when the base
getConnectionSchemaName has changes so it would return null in the case
of an OfflineConnection but PostgresDatabse still used old code and
would fail on an offline connection.
This evolution adds the getconnectionSchemaNameCallStatement that can be
overridden by databases that only need to customise the statement, that
way the logic is shared with the abstract class.

If the copy rows function is called with no copy columns, you'll end up with an invalid SQL statement.

This occurs when you try to add a single column to a table in an SQLITE database. This occurs because to alter table with an SQLite database you create a temporary table and copy over the rows.

1) set the boolean flag and have the insertGenerator emit a comma to join successive values
2) have a higher level code construct use the seperate head and value generators, and have the higher level emit the dbms specific linking code","0","0"

This included refactoring small amounts of the ChangeSet.java and AbstractJdbcDatabase.java file to centralize the Rollback statement execution code.  Rather than call the ExecutorService.execute method in the ChangeSet.java file when dealing with custom SQL rollback steps, a new overload of executeRollbackStatements in AbstractJdbcDatabase.java is called which takes the list of custom statements to execute.  Then, filtering of the SqlVisitors is done consistently both for custom rollback steps and automatically generated ones.","0","0"

Added two new ant types: DatabaseType and ChangeLogParametersType
These can be defined outside of the ant tasks and reused.
Migrated over the BaseLiquibaseTask to use the new types and ported over the old attributes to maintain backward compatibility.
Added two new abstract classes that extend from BaseLiquibaseTask that will encapsulate the common functionality from change log tasks and diff tasks. I performed the same migration of old attributes to the new types.
Still have to finish refactoring the diff tasks and generate change log tasks.
A lot of additional documentation and deprecation marking was completed and logging was added to notify users of deprecated attributes to migrate over to the new model.","0","0"

Added null checks for object name.

After the Diff refactoring, CreateTableChange is not having its columns serialized.
Issue is due to the method name getColumn in ChangeWithColumns.
This should be getColumns to match the expected getter name for columns.
Without this in CreateTableChange, the columns property won't be considered for serialization
as it won't have a valid read and write method.

I also encountered weird behavior with Oracle whereby an overly long description was correctly
limited to 255 characters but was for some reason being treated as 259 characters by oracle.
This thus resulted in a constraint violation as the length was then too long for the description.
Bit of a hack but I lowered the description length to 250 and that seems to work.","0","0"

"8143","MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDE5Nzkx",,"Be more conservative with regular expressions.

Starting with a non-greedy universal match causes Java's regular expression
engine to try to match zero characters followed by the rest of the pattern,
then 1 character followed by the rest of the pattern, and so on until it finds
a match. Since comments must appear at the _end_ of input, this ensures that
the regex engine does a maximal amount of work before eliminating a comment.
For queries of a ""reasonable"" size, this isn't an issue, but a 10 or 20
kilocharacter query is large enough to cause comment removal to take over a
second.

Since the replacement removes the trailing part of the match outright, I've
rewritten the filter regexes to do so directly, rather than by replacing the
trailing part with the preceding universal group, and removed the universal
group match. This permits the regex engine to skip from whitespace to
whitespace without evaluating all the intervening bytes, and avoids
backtracking entirely.

This bit my day job, in real life, on queries that insert entire PNG images
via hex-encoded strings. While this is an unreasonable query, it's not an
_unrealistic_ query. We worked around the problem by disabling stripComments,
but fixing the regex will improve overall performance.","0","0"

Added fix suggested for Holger Willebrandt for GetViewDefinitionGeneratorHsql.
Tested and it works fine now.

Revved hsqldb to version 2.2.9
This version adheres to the sql standards.
It contains a TABLE_CONSTRAINTS table in the information_schema.
Added checks for HsqlDatabase to Int, Double, BigInt and Boolean toDatabaseType methods.
Sizes were being incorrectly appended. E.g. boolean(0);

Fixed bug with setting defaultSchemaName.
The default schema name that is set should be corrected by the implementing database.
E.g. setting 'liquibaseb' as the default schema name for Hsqldb is actually setting 'LIQUBASEB' as the defualt schema name.
This difference means that snapshot checks fail to realize that the DatabaseChangeLogLock table already exists.

Modified the correctObjectName method in AbstractJdbcDatabase.
Based on a conditional property unquotedObjectsAreUppercased, unquoted objects are either uppercased or lowercased.
This reflects typical database handling. Quoted objects don't have their case changed in any database that I've worked with.","0","0"

The column label will fall back to the name if no label is specified. If one is specified then typically it's specified for a reason (standards compatibility).

"8323","MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDE5Nzkx","damienbiggs","Added support for next value from a sequence for inserts

Added field valueSequenceNext to ColumnConfig. Value for field is a sequence name.
Added string to AbstractDatabase to represent the next value database syntax.
Added setting of this value from Databases that support sequences.
I used google to get the next value syntax for each database.
The only databases that I have tested though are h2, derby, hsql and postgresql.
Added changeset to common.tests.changelog.xml to test using the next value from a sequence on insert.

Added several fixes to get the postgres integration tests to run.
Overrode doGetDefaultSchema to always return 'public' I'm not sure how this was working for other people?

Removed overriding of correctObjectName for postgres. Postgres supports mixed case so lowercasing all objects
is incorrect. This caused the precondition integration test for the compound index to break.

in JdbcDatabaseSnapshotGenerator, I removed the logic for converting the result set according to the types list.
Now it just loops through the result set and adds each column to the map.
For my postgres database, this had one more field than was in the actual result set thus causing an index out of bounds exception.
The comment about the data type in the result set being incorrect is true.
Instead I always read out the value as a string and convert it when needed to an Integer Object.
I also changed the method used to get the column name from getColumnName to getColumnLabel.
For H2, COLUMN_SIZE was not present, instead the name was CHARACTER_MAX_LENGTH.
The label values appear to be correct for all the databases I've tested.

For SelectSequencesGeneratorPostgres, I added a clause to exclude non lowercase sequences that are owned by a column.

I added Postgres as a database that can support cascade drop. This means that when dropping a table with a serial type,
the sequence for the serial type is also removed.

For AddDefaultValueGeneratorPostgres, the sequence that is added should be owned by the column that it is now the default value for.
This is to make it consistent with the serial datatype in postgres. Otherwise, when doing a drop table cascade for that table, the
sequence will not be deleted.

Added a concept of data types that can't be modified to AbstractDatabase. For postgres types like int4, they should never be converted to
int4(10). This was happening for the database export / import tests.

Removed code that added the second word of a datatype as additional information.
E.g. character varying would be converted to CHARACTER VARYING varying.
The comment mentioned that it was for types like int unsigned but it looked like it would turn that into INT UNSIGNED unsigned as well.","0","0"

=======
Replaced removing indexes by marking indexes.
Now Indexes will be created always even they have associations with foreignKey, primaryKey or uniqueConstraint.
To fix it I added new attribute to createIndex xml-element:
<.. associatedWith="""" ..>
It may contain one or list of associations or be an empty.

Executing or skiping createIndex command depends of database type.
For Oracle it will executed if it's empty or associated only with foreignKey.
By default it will executed only if it's empty.

There are two equals ways to set up columns default value in oracle.
1. DEFAULT (0)
2. DEFAULT 0

In both cases it will work as insertion '0' number-type value into cell.
But in [1] Liquibase recognizes '(0)' as VARCHAR2-type value, and then it wrapped it by [ ' ].

that can return more than just a text string for a DataType, in this

In this patch.
1. added on delete and on update statements for FK constraints.
2. added unique for ""createIndex"" (before was missing).

Also was found some minor problems.
1. There is no support for unique constraints. (in the source code i found some implementation but is was commented out).
2. There is no support for escaping constraints name, indexes name.


Also, made SqlDatabaseSnapshot abstract and forced subtypes for easier extension in the future

Matching and merging steps now honor ""options.permissions"". 

Also introduced ""config:get-default-data-hub-permissions()"" to do what effectively was being done before in DHF - instead of an assumption that the user has default perms (which were rest-reader/rest-writer), DHF has an explicit function for defining default permissions for documents that were being inserted solely with a user's default permissions.

As a result, MasterTest now passes when run as a data-hub-operator.

Moved the guts of this from DataHubImpl to DhsDeployer. The ""dhsDeploy"" method in the DataHub interface was only used by the DhsDeployTask and thus is safe to remove (it is really an internal API that never should have been exposed in the DataHub interface). 

Removed LoadHubSchemasCommand, which has been OBE for multiple releases.

- Added FlowRunner.runFlowWithoutProject, along with new FlowInputs class to encapsulate all the possible inputs
- Subclassed FlowRunnerTest and MappingTest so that all of the tests in those two classes are now also run via runFlowWithoutProject","0","0"

I am not sure if this is the expected behavior, but it seems better to log and ignore these conditions as opposed to throwing errors, which happens via the Test button in QS - though the errors aren't reported, they're just logged. 

Also ensuring that the ""map"" namespace prefix is visible in the compiled XSLT. I have not been able to reproduce this issue via a unit test yet, but it happens via QS when using a nested entity property.","0","0"

* Creating FlowRunner Class (#1865)

* Creating FlowRunner, Collector and listeners

* Implement the new Collector

* Pass ""step"" to ml:runFlow endpoint

* Debug export tweak + lion share of provenance work

Implemented:
  createFlowRecord(flowId, options)  -- currently unused, as I don't believe flow info is tracked, just the use of the flow.
  createJobRecord(jobId, flowId, info)
  createStepRecord(jobId, flowId, stepType, docURI, info) {

TODO:
 * Wrap use of provenance API in eval() statement & point to JOBDATABASE
 * Incorporate info.metadata property key/values into provenance data
 * Create query function to search by document uri and return full history
 * Tombstone prov function when a document is deleted (need to determine what this is)

* Add mlLogLevel to thec ustom tokens and default settings

* Actually check in the prior commit of mlLogLevel custom tokens and default settting

* Add datahub base object, constructors where necessary, stubs in some spots for right now

* DHFPROD-1802 - stub and empty constructor for process.sjs, todo fill out

* create new extensions and transforms for 5, mlcp transform and hubstats/hubversion

* prov.sjs config tweaks

* Wrapped provenance calls in xdmp.eval()

* Let's remove these, accidentally were checked in.

* Moving uuid() to hub-utils.sjs, refactoring create and delete document methods (#1873)

* Update to prov.sjs: Added metadata, on-the-fly flowTypes via info.status

The library now has the ability to log the status in provenance for Steps, Jobs and Flows.

Pass any info.status for these types to their respective functions:
  createFlowRecord(flowId, info)
  createJobRecord(jobId, flowId, info)
  createStepRecord(jobId, flowId, stepType, docURI, info)

if info.status is defined, a custom on-the-fly flowType will be generated
that we can use to lookup the provenance information.

* create new extensions and transforms for 5, mlcp transform and hubstats/hubversion

* Expose the hub log level variable ont he hubconfing interface

* Add defaultConfig if one isn't provided at datahub object creation for override purposes

* Correct spelling of createOn to createdOn

* Default and overridable configs for all the things!

* DHFPROD-1802 - flesh out process.sjs more regarding getting/searching for process artifacts

* Add additional keys to the process object

* Tweaking prov.sjs to use config object, adding delete process to process.sjs, adding default metadata timestamps to mlcp-flow-transforms, and adding a default 'dummy' main.sjs process to test flows with

* Add flow and runflow endpoint extensions, todo: flesh out runflow

* Add RunFlowTask for 5.x flows (#1867)

Add RunLegacyFlowTask for 4.x flows
Add access to FlowRunnerImpl in FlowManager

* DHFPROD-1710 - update for flow running

* Add new gradle task group for running flows

* Create job docs, todo: add batching for running the processor instead of single run in the flow

* UUID generation, queryDocRecords() function implemented

* prov.sjs config tweaks

* Wrapped provenance calls in xdmp.eval()

* Let's remove these, accidentally were checked in.

* Moving uuid() to hub-utils.sjs, refactoring create and delete document methods (#1873)

* Update to prov.sjs: Added metadata, on-the-fly flowTypes via info.status

The library now has the ability to log the status in provenance for Steps, Jobs and Flows.

Pass any info.status for these types to their respective functions:
  createFlowRecord(flowId, info)
  createJobRecord(jobId, flowId, info)
  createStepRecord(jobId, flowId, stepType, docURI, info)

if info.status is defined, a custom on-the-fly flowType will be generated
that we can use to lookup the provenance information.

* DHFPROD-1813 - also added language, so that would now appear in the declared artifacts

* DHFPROD-1851 Initial e-node step work (#1895)

* DHFPROD-1851 pre/post hook and ensure MLCP transform compatibility (#1900)

* DHFPROD-1851 Ensure MLCP transform is working properly

* New collector, FlowRunner, post method for jobs and other misc changes (#1904)

* Convert 'options' to json in collector, fix javadocs and other misc changes (#1909)

* Deploy default artifacts (#1908)

* Change Process to Step
Deploy mappings to final as well
Change step artifact uri to steps (align with flows)

* Add LoadHubArtifactsCommand to deploy default mappings and flow

* Deploy default artifacts (#1915)

* Get resource as stream to work in both jar file and via IDE

* Add LoadHubArtifactsCommand to deploy default steps and flows

* Adds capability to iterate over all dirs under flows and steps

* DHFPROD-1853 - WIP

* DHFPROD-1853 - tweaks to make things run

* Better error logging via MLCP

* DHFPROD-1853 - additional cleanup to run the main.sjs

* DHFPROD-1853 - Mocking out the default ingest just so we have something to ingest with, tweaks to mlcp-flow-transform to handle it

* DHFPROD-1853 - accept a mapping response better, actually attempt to cast values according to datatype, todo: still handle arrays

* Add test for hubDeployArtifacts command (#1920)

* DHFPROD-1853 - Tweaking of the mapping code to handle nested entities, arrays of values, and arrays of entities.

* DHFPROD-1854 Initial step prov work (#1930)

* Printing the fullOuput if ""options.fullOutput"" is set (#1935)

* Setting 'fullOutput' of type Map and returning 'documents' only if 'fullOutput' is set (#1936)

* Update the export jobs task to be for legacy jobs, update our tests that are for the legacy flow running to use runlegacy task instead

* Actually publish the legacy jobs export task might help.

* Update deploy hub artifact test (#1942)

* Remove dummy flow file

* Update hubDeployArtifact test to account for default flows as well

* Because I might be dyslexic.

* DHFPROD-1715 - correction based on @akshaysonvane feedback","0","1"

After instantiating a new Debug object with config, a simple JSON object
payload can be passed to the send() function.  If that object's ""type""
property is allowed by the current log level, then the output tagged
with metadata and the complete JSON object is passed as a string to
xdmp.log()

A payload type value that is not of an accepted type is rejected.
A payload type value that requires a higher log level than currently specified is rejected.

All rejected payloads return an Error object with message:
""Error: Log level ""{this.logLevel}"" does not have permission to log type: {payload type}""

If we want, we can add payload validation, ensuring that the payload type has the proper
parameters (ie. error should required a ""stack"" property in the payload object)

I won't be able to make improvements over this code, as I am out of time.  It is functional, but not elegant.  Ideal solution would have hooked into routing and somehow listened to the routing events, updating the DummyComponent template information dynamically.  After over 10 hours sunk into trying to figure that out, I went with the dynamic creation of DummyComponent and their templates instead, which renders a simple component template with the route path text.

* Build fix - files no longer used.

Previously taken from Ops Dir to try to stub router and manipulate, which didn't pan out.   Removing to fix build.

- Add new Bootstrap tooltips for index icons
- Replace existing MDL tooltips with Bootstrap tooltips
- Add help icons to mapping and entities views
- Destination docs page for help icons to come

* Some cleanup of comments and interfaces

* fixed path

* Fix ssl issue (#1587)

* Autowiring fail fixed

* Fixes issue where mlUsername/mlPassword were not set in gradle.properties

If they're set in gradle-local.properties but not gradle.properties, then the properties were not being set because hubConfig.withPropertiesFromEnvironment was not being called. 

Not familiar with writing DHF tests yet, but we definitely need a test where mlUsername/mlPassword are not in gradle.properties

* Better fix for passing Gradle properties into HubConfigImpl (#1594)

Added a comment for the part I'm not sure about - given that we don't want HubConfigImpl to load from gradle.properties when using Gradle (since Gradle has already loaded all the properties from that file and applied the properties plugin to them), when do we want to do this? Does the QS app expect to read from a gradle.properties file? Maybe just JUnit test cases?

* 1546 Using DeployOtherDatabasesCommand to deploy all databases (#1595)

The set of staging commands no longer has the database commands; since the final commands are executed first, they have the database commands, and DeployOtherDatabasesCommand is modified to use a custom impl of DeployDatabaseCommand that accounts for some DHF-specific stuff. 

Will soon have a single list of commands a single AppConfig.

* 1547 Deploying all servers via a single command (#1598)

* 1548 No more special handling for security resources (#1599)

ml-gradle can handle all security resources, with the exception of hub amps - those are still in a separate list of commands with their own tasks (though they're still deployed as part of mlDeploy). 

Also fixed the hub-specific amp tasks - those still need a constructor for DeployHubAmpsCommand so they can pass in a HubConfig instance.

* Fix for DHFPROD-1552, failing ssl tests (#1600)

* Fix for DHFPROD-1552, qs issue

* Fix hostname verifier for Collector, modify the tests

* 1561 Fix for ordering database commands (#1605)

See comments on the DeployHubDatabaseCommand constructor

* 1561 Removing line that disables database ordering

* Setting version back to 4.0.3 (#1607)

* Changing the paths for trigger files, fixing tests (#1608)

* 1562 Updating indexes now reuses mlDatabaseCommands for consistency (#1609)

Note the comments about how ""mlUpdateIndexes"" in ml-gradle differs from how it works. That's probably fine though - I'm not 100% sure that the implementation in ml-gradle is how it should be.

* 1562 Disabling forest creation when updating indexes (#1611)

* 1551 mlLoadModules and mlWatch now work properly (#1612)

Renamed LoadUserStagingModulesCommand to LoadHubUserCommand to make it more clear what it does (since it's not staging-specific). 

Depends on ml-gradle 3.10.2, which I just released, which provides a hook in WatchTask for HubWatchTask to use.

* Removing the modules from ml-modules in pii-test (#1613)

* mlLoadModules no longer depends on hubDeployUserModules

* DHFPROD-1557 - remove used vectors for memory leak issue

* Because I'm bad at things and prematurely check things in.

* use hubDeployUserModules for loading hub specific modules
test cleanup

* 1563 Fixing module loading when final server is using SSL (#1614)

* Resetting the hubConfig to its default values (#1616)

* Wiring clients after changing hubConfig (#1622)

* Fixed how the hub-specific amp tasks are defined (#1621)

They were technically fine before, but with this approach, they have a description.

* Corrected comment for modifying mlForestCommands (#1620)

* Add ""Description"" for project.task() (#1623)","0","0"

To resolve the issue of long collection names wrapping, then
the facet will utilize a different style class so the text is
smaller and will appear in a single line.  The facet value length
will be compared to determine if the custom class will be utilized
or not.

Added similar logic to the chiclet since the previous chiclets
were not being displayed properly, all the UI would show was
""Collection:"" and you would not be able to see any text.  Added
hover over tooltip for the chiclet values so that the user can
see the full facet name.","0","0"

Changelog:
-> The API now prints what's happening to System.out in a very verbose manner.
-> A massive bug has been found and replaced. The liveSync() method when called after sync() would immediately start executing since there was no provision to wait for the sync() method to end before the liveSync() method is called. This functionality is now provided by the hold method which basically waits for the DBSynchronizer thread to finish its run before continuing further execution.
-> Minor code changes in the lastSyncTimestamp() function that could throw an exception inside the DBSynchronizer class. Some other minor changes elsewhere.","0","0"
