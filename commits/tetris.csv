Unlike C++, Python has no problem with having useful object

Instead of doing ""move - check position - unmove - move again if

new position, check that and then move if ok.

Also, replacing separate x, y, z attributes with a tuple reduces a
few lines of code.","0","0"
"412","MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjUzNDQ1OQ==","isagalaev","Moving run() out of TetrisInputProcessor.

This is going to be the main theme of the refactoring. Since it's
not Java, there's no need to define everything as classes. It makes
Python code less readable with all those millions of `self.` and it
encourages usage of class attributes instead of simple local vars.
A rule of thumb is: if you're creating an single instance of a class
that lives through the whole program lifetime it shouldn't be a
class. Same goes for classes with a single public method.

Here's what's changed here:

- run() has been moved out of the class and lost its `self`
- instead run() creates an instance of the TetrisInputProcessor,
  which in turn will probably go away in the future as having a
  whole class to hold a single var looks like an overkill.","0","0"

A context manager is a common idiom to define blocks with
guaranteed resource release. They can be defined as classes but
there's a nicer syntax using contextlib.contextmanager that lets
you define a function with a single `yield` in the middle, so you
can acquire resources before that and release them after.

Also after extracting those it seems that the thing with termios
attrs is not needed as you don't set anything before doing the work,
so there's probably nothing to restore. But I'm not the judge here.","0","0"

If set to ""yes"" (case insesitive), the built-in classes will be
used without prompting.

If set to ""no"", the built-in classes won't be used (again, no
prompting).

In any other case, we'll fallback to the previous behaviour. That

I didn't fix the issue, but I have some guidance on how to do so. You need to add a pause that shows the dungeon with all of the searched states X-ed out on each iteration. Additionally, you need to figure out if the state returned by makePlayable is the one it is supposed to be ... should be a state that does NOT have an X but is right next to one ... one of the states where you removed a wall. @jakeryang","0","0"

However, for now, I've just fixed the link visualization so that
recurrent links will be drawn in green. To determine if a link is
recurrent, I compare the indexes of the source and target neurons in the
archetype to see if the link goes forward or backward.

#249
Created OldToNewGhostIntermediaryController. As of right now, it takes a SharedNNGhosts<T> as its constructor. This is given to it in the only place it is constructed, MsPacManTask. The idea behind this class is that all of the decision making logic will be performed in this class. It contains four ZombieControllers and a MASController  made up of those four ZombieControllers. This class will set the moves of each of the zombies (one per ghost). When the MASController calls the getMove method, it will return those moves given to the Zombies by this class.

#250
MsPacManTask now constructs OldToNewGhostIntermediaryController correctly.

#251
Created POGhostsCheckEachDirectionMediator

#252
Created ZombieGhost.java. These are the ghosts that return moves set by the OldToNewGhostIntermediaryController. I am not sure how this code will ever interface with Piers competition code but this is the only way I could interface with our code.

#253
Added a classOption in Parameters.java called staticPacManPO. It builds a starter pacman to evolve against.

Altered MMNEAT to not crash when trying to evolve ghosts.

Added a constructor to GhostControllerFacade that takes an OldToNewGhostInterMediaryController.

Added methods getAction and getMove to NewGhostController in a similar fashion to NewPacManController. Because many classes extend NewGhostController, I added the unimplemented methods to each. getAction and getMove will never be called except by my new code, so this addition is backwards compatible. The files affect are:

Static methods for creating these data structres from a bot instance are now available, which are needed to send as parameters to many of the old-style bot Actions.

However, this also caused some changes in the type of PathPlanner used by UT^2, so we need to check and make sure that UT^2 still works appropriately.

Note also that the way the AgentMemory constructs its PathPlanners may be problematic ... may need to create them once and save them somewhere for later.

I thought that the main problem was that each separate eval thread did
not have its own input/output mediator. This is certainly a problem, but
changing this did not fix the exception I received. Also, this change
introduces some inefficient copying. If this doesn't allow for parallle
evals, then it is not worth keeping it around, so I will immediately
revert this commit in a moment. Still, I want to be able to access this
code in the future if I change my mind.

the example bots. We need to be on the look out for errors from this
upgrade ... we'll keep all of these changes in the dev_ut2004 branch

It seems to work, in the sense that it loads the data and runs evolution in a seemingly correct way, but the current result is bad (which is actually somewhat expected ...). However, there are ways to improve it. For starters, the input and output values are currently not scaled in anyway, so the fact that I am using tanh activation functions would make it impossible to solve these problems currently. I also wonder if the MSE calculation is correct ... I'll need to look into it.

For now, the task runs, there is a default CSV file to test it with (contains made up data for a simple polynomial) and a batch file that runs the experiment.","0","0"

I also added a batch file that runs deterministic evals in Tetris and swiches with HybrID.

The only small problem left is that it only works if the substrate
network uses the ReLU activation function for both the hidden neurons
and the output. The output should actually be tanh or a regular sigmoid,
but my HyperNEAT networks don't have a way of specifying different
activation functions for different layers yet.

However, I did make a related change: there is now an option to make the
input neurons use the ID activation function, which is actually a
standard convention that I have ignored for years.

Other changed include: swapping of substrate width and height when
defining input shape for DL4J, and deletion of an unnecessary method in
TWEANN that had actually been replaced by one in ActivationFunctions.

NOTE: There was a bit of trouble getting the test to work in the context
of all other tests during Maven install, so I had to go back and tweak
substrate initialization and other issues with global variables that

There is still work to be done in TensorNetworkFromHyperNEATSpecification.

@DarwinJohnson
After lots of fiddling, I think this is something that we can settle on
for the SCOPE poster. I've removed irrelevant batch files from the SCOPE
research dir and just put them in the standard Othello subdir. There is
only one batch file left, and all it does is evolve Othello players
using regular NEAT vs the WPC. In my trial run, it looks like the
performance achieved during evolution is 80% win rate, which is about
75% win rate in post evals. It is also nice that the fitness starts low
and goes up over time.

Although I still feel that it should be possible to do better, I'm going
to close #455 based on this conclusion.","0","0"

HyperNEAT is still being used, but to evolve a ""network"" with only an
input and output layer. This is thus equivalent to a weighted piece

random move percent affects both players (evolved and WPC) in such a
weird way that it causes problems.

to refactor.

Looking at the eval functions that come with microRTS, it looks like
they all define some sort of base_score method that always generates a
score from the perspective of a particular player. However, the actual
evaluate method then returns the base score of the max player minus the
base score of the min player. I have adjusted our code to do the same.

@DarwinJohnson I found a ton of errors and problems and fixed most of
them. I've created some issues associated with issues I've found and
simply fixed others.

I believe that #409 is ok now, but I want you to do some unit tests, and
also add some assertions that make sure the winner list is never an
unusual size.

I also believe that #401 is ok, but I want you to do extensive testing
with many batch files, and also make some JUnit tests.

#410 is a new issue you still have to address. We should talk about it.

#408 is also a new issue that needs to be fixed and JUnit tested.

#411 is about JUnit tests on the Othello WPC. I don't think there are
currently any problems, but I want tests to make sure.

There were major issues with both heuristics and fitness functions. The
fitness functions were not properly taking into account who the current
player way, so that the value they returned was sometimes the same for
both players. Heuristic functions and minimax were incorrectly assuming
that the current player always wanted to maximize the score (I think I
steered you wrong on this) but the reality is that the first player
wants to maximize the score and the second player wants to minimize it.
This means all heuristic functions should be interpreted as indicating
how good the state is for player 1 (negative scores are good for player
2).

This update is a lot of changes. Look around and test things out. Make
sure everything works, and add lots of assertions. If you don't know why
I changed something, then ask me about it (feel free to do so
immediately in email or on GitHub so you don't forget to ask).","0","0"

Now the network displays at the correct size before the evaluation

because LonerTask displays the network before it executes the evaluation
code, but in the old code, the map size change occurred inside of the
evaluation code. Now, the map change happens in the new preEval method
(from LonerTask, but overridden in MicroRTSTask).

There is a very important followup issue associated with this. Similar
code changes need to be made to the coevolution code. Specifically, the
SinglePopulationCoevolutionTask needs a preEval method whose default

#330  Added an inner class to MIDIUtil that controls playback of note

previously written playback loop, but it also has a method that can be
called to stop playback.

This new class is used in Breedesizer so that any other button click
will stop the playback.

The Thread trick used here is similar to what is done already when
playing individual amplitude arrays. However, that earlier code is
problematic because it uses global static variables and does not return

it's accurate). Then, I found a method online that wrote a single

led to some issues trying to figure out how to initialize AudioFormat,
and the method ultimately didn't work. files would save, but I couldn't
specify where they saved so they ended up in the general MMNEAT folder

initially using a sine function, and then using a square wave function
and triangle function from ActivationFunctions.java. The sine function
generated a wide variety of noises and graphs - quiet noises had a very
small amplitude and loud noises had larger amplitudes. The pitch was not
manipulated in the mutations, but timbre and volume displayed great
variety. A lot of very interesting images were also generated when the
functions were plotted using linePlot() in GraphicsUtil. The square wave
function had some sudden dropoffs, and the triangle functions generated
more spikes, which created a scratchy quality in many of the mutations.

When a HyperNEAT task is used to seed the initial population, a boolean
is set that makes TWEANNGenotypes use a different type of NodeGene and
LinkGene. Specifically, several optional fields are not included, which
allows the size (in memory) of the networks to be smaller.

For example, in trial runs in Tetris, the size of network xml save files
drops from 38,860KB to  26,069KB. More could be done if the link weights
were switched from doubles to floats, but I fear that this could
actually affect evolution performance.

Despite this change, I might still have memory problems. A lot of my

instances ... there are more Live instances than there should be per

The HyperNEATCPPNGenotype was actually initializing the innovation
numbers wrong so that they were organized in column-major order rather
than row-major order. This means that inputs and connections would have
been set up in a weird way that didn't correspond to the coordinate
frame.

Additionally, the SubstrateMLP had similar but different problems. It's
links were being established correctly, but the inputs were being loaded
incorrectly. Additionally, the outputs were being extracted incorrectly.
This once again has to do with the distinction between row- and
column-major ordering.

At this point, but the TWEANNs generated by HyperNEATCPPNGenotype and
the SubstrateMLP are identical in their behavior ... at least, the
testProcess test of SubstrateMLPTest passes. The valuesTest still fails,
but I'll leave that to Lauren.

There are also pieces of commented print statements all over the place

I fixed the NetworkUtilTest, but SubstrateMLP still has problems. I did
find some genuine errors, but they were small. The main issue was that
my TWEANN activates input neurons before they transmit, which is
actually NOT the standard neural network model, but should be harmless
to do. However, the SubstrateMLP was wrong because it didn't take the
quirk of my TWEANN into account. The other changes I made to Substrate
MLP were just for tidiness.

However, SubstrateMLP and TWEANNs generated by CPPNs are still not
compatible, and I know why: the structures are slightly different
because of reflections across the diagonals of the substrates. I think
the error might actually be in the HyperNEATCPPNGenotype in how it
matches up innovation numbers with nodes. They seem to count down across
columns rather than across rows. However, a simple attempt at fixing
this did not immediately solve the problem, so I reverted changes to
that class for now.

Need to look closely at both SubstrateMLP and HyperNEATCPPNGenotype. For
now, I've left some commented debugging code in certain classes.

The problem was the absolute value function! This is the only activation
function whose value is not restricted to a finite range. This was
causing network activations to rise to the point where they reached
infinity, and once you introduce that you get all kinds of problems like
NaN values. These NaN values made images look terrible, ruined the image
match fitness function, but also broke the ""contract"" of sorting
comparators, causing the exceptions with TimSort. I was able to remove
the system property to use the legacy sorting method. I found the error
by adding tons of asserts to the code. Since asserts only run when a
command line parameter is set, I'm going to go ahead and leave them in
... they were really helpful!

With this fix, the French Flag can be evolved again. The absolute value
function must have been disabled the time I initially evolved it, but I
suppose it got reactivated in a commit that someone else made.

Completed TorusEvolvedPredatorVsStaticPreyTask so that predators are

The user specifies which of the agents (the prey or the predators) get
evolved by specifying which task will be used. I then created a
super/parent class called ""TorusPredPreyTask"" which contained most of
the code in the two specific children classes (extended by the two
specific evolving prey or predator classes) so that I was then able to
delete almost all of the code in the children, leaving only a
