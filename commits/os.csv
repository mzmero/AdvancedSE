* Handle SYSTEM_LOGICAL_PROCESSOR_INFORMATION_EX union as subclassing

The union embedded in SYSTEM_LOGICAL_PROCESSOR_INFORMATION_EX has a
dynamic size. So at decoding time the size depends on the Relationship
code embedded in the structure.

Instead of trying to press this through the default JNA union 
deserialization, model the four cases created by the four embedded
structures in the dummy union as separate subclasses of 
SYSTEM_LOGICAL_PROCESSOR_INFORMATION_EX.

Summary:
This change adds bytesRead and bytesWritten fields to OSProcess.
An implementation is provided for MacProcess which uses `proc_pid_rusage(pid, RUSAGE_INFO_V2, ...)`.
Note that RUSAGE_INFO_V2 is only available on MacOSX 10.9+.

Test Plan:
Successfully obtained process io stats on MacOSX 10.10 and 10.11.
Verified that `mvn test` succeeds.

Bringing all lessons learned from waffle over to oshi in one go.

* Additionally raised to java 1.6.
* Assembly is now performed on all builds.
* Use sonatype parent
* Added inception year
* Added organization
* Require Maven 3.2.3 or better
* Added issues management
* Added ci management
* Added distribution for site pages to github gh pages
* Added copyright
* Added maven properties for java version (source and test side)
* Added maven build timestamp
* Set project and reporting encoding to UTF-8
* Added entire default plugin set to control the build level of each
even if not otherwise used.  This is intended to override mavens hidden
base parent
* Set incremental compilation at false due to maven bug and note the
jira ticket
* Set site page to allow markdown usage in order to show readme
* Switch from legacy emma code coverage to jacoco code coverage
* Add all the various reports such as javadocs, checkstyles, findbugs,
pmd, nvd scan for security, etc
* Add patch for git commit id for manifest along with jira to same issue
* Add build time, copyright, os informaton, compiler information to
manifest for all resulting builds
* Remove rather manual pieces of release to nexus
* Keep gpg signing in case we need to use deploy when maven release
plugin fails so we can get to sonatype regardless","0","0"
